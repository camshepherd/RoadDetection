# RoadDetection
Python script to identify the road in stills from the path of a self-driving car using OpenCV and not utilising Numpy functions properly.

# About 
From the third year of University, attempts to detect the location of the road on images through computer vision and image processing methods. It turns out that the code has probably been lost permanently, but it was incredibly poorly optimised anyway.
